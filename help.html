                                Happydia (Happy-Social-Media) is a browser extension that
                                helps you out by cleaning up sad, triggering, and sometimes just plain annoying news
                                from your social media feeds.

                                While your webpage is loading, Happydia looks at the site and
                                compares them against a list of banned words ( Sad / Politics / Depressing ... ) it was
                                built to block. If it finds any, it blocks them.

                                Where do the blocking and hiding filters come from?

                                Happydia, like all ad blockers, relies on filter rules to know what to block and hide on
                                the web pages you visit. You can check the list of filtred words in our Github
                                repository. (Inside "data/" folder)
